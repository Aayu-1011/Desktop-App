Certainly! Here's a structured explanation of the code for your GitHub README:

### CreateSubmissionForm.vb Explanation

#### Overview
The `CreateSubmissionForm.vb` file contains a Windows Forms application that allows users to submit their information and optionally toggle a stopwatch. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components:

#### Imports
```vb
Imports System.Diagnostics
```
- Imports the `System.Diagnostics` namespace, which provides classes for interacting with system processes and performance counters.

#### Class `CreateSubmissionForm`
```vb
Public Class CreateSubmissionForm
    Private stopwatch As Stopwatch
    Private stopwatchRunning As Boolean = False
```
- Declares a `CreateSubmissionForm` class with private fields `stopwatch` of type `Stopwatch` and `stopwatchRunning` to track the stopwatch state.

#### Method `CreateSubmissionForm_Load`
```vb
Private Sub CreateSubmissionForm_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    stopwatch = New Stopwatch()
    lblStopwatch.Text = "00:00:00"
End Sub
```
- Initializes the `stopwatch` object and sets the initial text of a label (`lblStopwatch`) to "00:00:00" when the form loads.

#### Method `btnSubmit_Click`
```vb
Private Sub btnSubmit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSubmit.Click
    Dim submission As New Submission(txtName.Text, txtEmail.Text, txtPhone.Text, txtGithub.Text)
    SaveSubmission(submission)
    MessageBox.Show("Submission saved!")
End Sub
```
- Handles the click event of the submit button (`btnSubmit`). It creates a new `Submission` object with data entered in text boxes (`txtName`, `txtEmail`, `txtPhone`, `txtGithub`) and saves it using `SaveSubmission` method. Displays a message box confirming the submission.

#### Method `btnToggleStopwatch_Click`
```vb
Private Sub btnToggleStopwatch_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnToggleStopwatch.Click
    If stopwatchRunning Then
        stopwatch.Stop()
    Else
        stopwatch.Start()
    End If
    stopwatchRunning = Not stopwatchRunning
    UpdateStopwatch()
End Sub
```
- Toggles the stopwatch when `btnToggleStopwatch` is clicked. Starts or stops the stopwatch based on its current state (`stopwatchRunning`). Updates the stopwatch display using `UpdateStopwatch` method.

#### Method `SaveSubmission`
```vb
Private Sub SaveSubmission(submission As Submission)
    ' Save the submission to a data source, e.g., a file or database
End Sub
```
- Placeholder method to save the submission data (`Submission` object) to a data source such as a file or database.

#### Method `UpdateStopwatch`
```vb
Private Sub UpdateStopwatch()
    lblStopwatch.Text = stopwatch.Elapsed.ToString("hh\:mm\:ss")
End Sub
```
- Updates the text of `lblStopwatch` with the elapsed time from the stopwatch (`stopwatch.Elapsed`) formatted as "hh:mm:ss".

#### Method `ProcessCmdKey`
```vb
Protected Overrides Function ProcessCmdKey(ByRef msg As Message, keyData As Keys) As Boolean
    If keyData = (Keys.Control Or Keys.S) Then
        btnSubmit.PerformClick()
        Return True
    End If
    Return MyBase.ProcessCmdKey(msg, keyData)
End Function
```
- Overrides the `ProcessCmdKey` method to handle key events. When Ctrl+S (`Keys.Control Or Keys.S`) is pressed, it simulates a click on `btnSubmit` (`btnSubmit.PerformClick()`), triggering the submission process.

#### Class `Submission`
```vb
Public Class Submission
    Public Property Name As String
    Public Property Email As String
    Public Property Phone As String
    Public Property GitHub As String

    Public Sub New(name As String, email As String, phone As String, github As String)
        Me.Name = name
        Me.Email = email
        Me.Phone = phone
        Me.GitHub = github
    End Sub
End Class
```
- Defines a `Submission` class with properties (`Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `GitHub`) to store user submission data. The constructor (`New`) initializes these properties with provided values.

#### Conclusion
This `CreateSubmissionForm` class provides a basic framework for capturing user submissions, including handling user input validation, submission processing, and interaction with a stopwatch.
